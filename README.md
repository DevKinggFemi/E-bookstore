# E-bookstore-Test
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

# Bookstore - A Responsive Web Application

Bookstore is a responsive web application designed for book enthusiasts. It uses Node.js for the server, MongoDB as the database, and React for the front end. The app offers a wide selection of books, allowing users to filter books by preferred category and author. It integrates Redux to manage the user's cart and ensures secure authentication and validation of logged-in users. 

## Features

- **Book Filtering:** Browse and filter books by category and author to find the perfect read.

- **User Cart:** Manage your cart with Redux, adding or removing books for an easy shopping experience.

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication, ensuring that only logged-in users can access the cart and make payments.

- **Payment Processing:** The app integrates Stripe for seamless and secure payment processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** The server is built using Node.js, providing robust back-end support.

- **MongoDB:** MongoDB serves as the database, ensuring efficient data storage.

- **React:** The front-end is powered by React, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user interface.

- **Redux:** Redux is used for state management, making the shopping cart experience smooth.

- **Stripe:** For secure and reliable payment processing.



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
